# Road Map #

Here are a list of features I intend to implement in the near future:

  * Environment variable expansion. E.g. `<`PATH>%PATH%;..\..\bin`<`/PATH`>`
  * Server start-up dependencies.
  * Regex TTY scanning for start-up success failure.
  * TTY output logging.
  * Start-up progress screen.
  * Better handling of incoming TTY streams.
